# Non-Asymptotic analysis of Stochastic Optimisation

Author: Théophile Cantelobre

This is an independent reproduction of some of the experiments for "Non-Asymptotic Analysis of Stochastic Approximation Algorithms for Machine Learning" by Francis Bach and Eric Moulines (2013) for the Stochastic Optimisation course in the M2A masters program at Sorbonne Univeristé (course by Antoine Godichon-Baggioni and Arnaud Guyader).

The notebooks reproduce figures 1 and 2 from Bach & Moulines (2013).

The [report](https://github.com/theophilec/stochastic-optimisation/blob/main/report.pdf) presents the main results, reproduces the proof of Theorem 1 and discusses the results in the light of an asymptotic analysis. In particular, the robustness of the choice of rate 1/2 is discussed (see figure legends).
